# SE-SEIR

This repository provides supplementary material to the paper ``Heterogeneous risk tolerance, in-groups, and epidemic waves``
from the project ``Standards of Risk Evidence Driven Behavior-Disease Model``.

The folder ``Rsource`` contains two source packages required to reproduce the results in the paper: ``BSEIR`` and ``wavefinder``.
